# My AI Project
Building AI course project

## Summary
This project is created as part of the Building AI course. It demonstrates a simple idea for an AI-based application.

## Background
People face daily problems related to stress, lack of motivation, and poor planning.  
This project addresses these issues by proposing an AI assistant that supports mental wellbeing.  
It helps with:
- identifying stress patterns  
- improving work–rest balance  
- tracking mood  
- offering simple suggestions

## How is it used?
The user writes short notes about their day.  
The AI analyzes the text and returns supportive suggestions based on the mood.

Example:
- If mood is negative → suggest break or relaxation  
- If mood is positive → suggest productivity tasks

## Data sources and AI methods
Data source:
- user-written text only

AI methods:
- sentiment analysis (e.g. using transformer models)
- simple rule-based suggestions

Example code:
